Coinseeker.co is leveraging on The Internet Computer to host and run our platform at a capacity without bound. 
This repo currently contain the testing of web infrastructure components and developing of ICP canisters.  
<h2>How to Get Started</h2>
We have used the /dfx parent command with different flags and subcommands to register and deploy our static website on a local canister execution environment.
